## **What is Python?**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691936665880/05ee001b-1723-48de-b54d-800ada0311c5.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp align="left")

üêçPython is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with an elegant syntax that allows programmers to focus more on problem-solving than on syntax errors. One of the primary goals of Python Developers is to keep it fun to use. Python has become a big buzz in the field of modern software development, infrastructure management, and especially in [**Data Science**](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-data-science/)üî≠ and [**Artificial Intelligence**](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence/)üî¨. Most recently, Python has risen to the top 3 list of the TIOBE index of language popularity.

Python is becoming increasingly everywhere, but you must be wondering why Python has become such a hot topic in the developers‚Äô world. In this tutorial, you will understand all the reasons behind Python‚Äôs popularity.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èLet's Understand In Short Way:-

* Python is an Open source, general purpose, high-level, and object-oriented programming language.
    
* It was created by **Guido van Rossum**
    
* Python consists of vast libraries and various frameworks like Django, Tensorflow, Flask, Pandas, Keras etc.
    

### **How to Install Python?**

Here are the few steps, which are required for the installation of Python: -

1. **Visit the Official Website:** Go to the official Python website at [**python.org/downloads**](http://python.org/downloads) **in your web browser.**
    
2. **Choose a Version:** Python has multiple versions available, but it's recommended to choose the latest version from the Python 3. x series (e.g., Python 3.9). Python 3. x is the current and actively maintained version.
    
3. **Download the Installer:** On the Python website, click on the "Downloads" tab. You'll see various download options for different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). Choose the installer that matches your operating system.
    
4. **Run the Installer:**
    
    * **Windows:** Double-click the downloaded installer executable (usually named something like `python-3.9.6.exe`). Check the box that says "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" during the installation process. This will make it easier to run Python from the command line.
        
    * **macOS:** Double-click the downloaded installer package (usually named something like `python-3.9.6-macosx10.9.pkg`). Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
        
    * **Linux:** Python is often pre-installed on Linux systems. To check if Python is already installed, open a terminal and type `python3 --version`. If it's not installed, you can use your package manager to install it.
        

### **Task 1*: -* Install Python in your respective OS, and check the version**

To install Python on Linux, use the below command. Once the python is installed, check the version.

### **Task 2*: -* Data Types In Python**

The different Data Types in Python are as follows: -

### **Data Types Table:**

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Data Types</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Classes</strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Description</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Numeric</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>int, float, complex</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>holds numeric values</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>String</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>str</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>holds sequence of characters</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Sequence</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>list, tuple, range</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>holds collection of items</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Mapping</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>dict</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>holds data in key-value pair form</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Boolean</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>bool</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>holds either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Set</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>set, frozeenset</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>hold collection of unique items</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## **Python Numeric Data type:**

In Python, numeric data type is used to hold numeric values.

Integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers fall under python numbers category. They are defined as `int`, `float` and `complex` classes in Python.

* `int` - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
    
* `float` - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to **15** decimal places.
    
* `complex` - holds complex numbers.
    

We can use the `type()` function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to.

Let's see an example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692200097376/e0331023-4c65-403f-8255-9a8931c7f0e5.png align="center")

In the above example, we have created three variables named num1, num2 and num3 with values 21, 22**.0**, and `1+5j` respectively.

We have also used the `type()` function to know which class a certain variable belongs to.

Since,

* **21** is an integer value, `type()` returns `int` as the class of num1 i.e `<class 'int'>`
    
* **22.0** is a floating value, `type()` returns `float` as the class of num2 i.e `<class 'float'>`
    
* `1 + 5j` is a complex number, `type()` returns `complex` as the class of num3 i.e `<class 'complex'>`
    

## **Python List Data Type:**

Listüìù is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by commas and enclosed within brackets `[ ]`. For example, Here, we have created a list named languages with **4** strings values inside it

### **Access List Itemsüßè**

To access items from a list, we use the index number **(0, 1, 2 ...)**. For example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692249002316/7af003cb-c4d0-4960-aeef-08b9b642837a.png align="center")

In the above example, we have used the index values to access items from the languages list.

* `cars[2]` - access the second item from languages i.e. `Nexon`
    
* `cars.append` - Appending the item in list
    
* `cars[4]` - access the fourth item from languages i.e. `BMW`
    

## **Python Tuple Data Type:**

Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.

In Python, we use the parentheses `()` to store items of a tuple.

Here, the product is a tuple with a string value `India, Australia, England` and integer values **1, 2, 3**.

### **Access Tuple Items**

Similar to lists, we use the index number to access tuple items in Python. For example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692255384933/4f09fb83-68b5-4993-b537-6b1513adec96.png align="center")

## **Python String Data Type:**

String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692255889444/0bce34c2-b64c-4325-8ce4-84da0864de6d.png align="center")

In the above example, we have created string-type variables: name and message with values `'My name is Ajay Gite'` and `'Let's learn Python'` respectively.

## **Python Set Data Type:**

Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by commas inside braces `{ }`. For example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692268862756/2cd4263d-b581-44af-adce-aa85e29505b5.png align="center")

Here, we have created a set named student\_info with **5** integer values 2 with same number. So, while printing it doesn't display duplicate numbers.

Since sets are unordered collections, indexing has no meaning. Hence, the slicing operator `[]` does not work.

## **Python Dictionary Data Type:**

Python dictionary is an ordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs. Here, keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.

Let's see an example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692269215470/b5ef44d0-a25b-49b9-a195-9a8b57cecfbe.png align="center")

In the above example, we have created a dictionary named teams. Here,

1. **Keys** are `'Team'`, `'Captain'`, `'Vice-Captain'`
    
2. **Values** are `'India'`, `'Virat Kohli'`, `'Bumrah'`
    

### **Access Dictionary Values Using Keysüîê**

We use `keys` to retrieve the respective `value`. But not the other way around. For example,

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692269384588/6c386373-873a-4184-872e-10638b3dfa4c.png align="center")

Here, we have accessed values using keys from the capital\_city dictionary. Since `'Team'` is key, `teams['Team']` accesses its respective value i.e. `India` However, `'Virat Kohli'` is the value for the `'Captain'` key, so `teams['Virat Kohli']` throws an error message.
